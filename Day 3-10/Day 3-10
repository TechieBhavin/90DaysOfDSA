so today's topics which i have learnt : 
    - understanding recursion by printing something N times
    - what is recursion
    - what is stack overflow in recursion
    - stack space
    - what is base condition
    - what is recursive tree
    - solved basic problems related to recursion
so today's topics which i have learnt : 
    - basics of Backtracking
    - important thing to remember in B.T.
    - types of B.T. problems/algorithm
    - how it works?
    - B.T. problem identification
    - tried to learn some of the basics and technical problems 
    - tried to learn real life scenario to understand B.T. in better way.
